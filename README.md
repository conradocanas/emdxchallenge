## EMDX CHALLENGE

#### LIVE DEMO : https://conradocanas.github.io/emdxchallenge/

EMDX Front End technical test submitted to Cryptologic. This project is based on Vue with Axios to connect an API and WebSockets to target cryptocurrencies prices on real time.

##### CHALLENGE
âœ… BTC Converter view
The BTC view will contain a table with all the available exchanges with code, symbol and latest price. Also a calculator with an input for a value, a currency selector and a button to get the value in BTC.

You must use this (https://blockchain.info/ticker ) API to get the exchanges and convert the amount to BTC (back and forth).

âœ… Candlesticks graphic view

The Candlesticks graphic should have an OHLCV chart (we recommend trading-vue-js)
